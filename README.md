### C Programming: Memory Layout of an Example Program

## Overview

This project is inspired by the YouTube video *C Programming: Memory Layout of an Example Program*, which explains the structure of memory allocation in C. The video details how a C program’s memory is organized into distinct segments and provides insight into each section’s role:

- **Code Segment**: Stores the compiled instructions of the program.
- **Data Segment**: Includes initialized and uninitialized (BSS) sections, storing global and static variables.
- **Heap**: Allocates memory dynamically at runtime.
- **Stack**: Manages local variables and function call details.

By understanding this layout, programmers can better manage memory and debug issues related to memory usage in C programs.

## Origins of "Foo" in Programming  


https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/foo-in-software-programming#:~:text=Foo%20%28pronounced%20FOO%29%20is%20a%20term%20used%20by,like%20it%20are%20formally%20known%20as%20metasyntactic%20variables.

The term **"foo"** has a rich history in the world of programming and computer science. Its origins trace back to early computer science communities, where it became popular as a placeholder name in code examples, documentation, and informal discussions. "Foo," along with its counterpart "bar," is often used to represent generic or abstract concepts in code examples, such as variable names or function placeholders.

Its widespread use has made "foo" a part of programming culture, recognized across languages and development environments as a symbol of generalized or temporary terms in code.
